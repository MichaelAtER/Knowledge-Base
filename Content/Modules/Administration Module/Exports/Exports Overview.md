# Exports

Use the Export options to either download account data or export Incident information for state reporting or medical billing purposes. The Export List options are determined by the subscription package and departmentâ€™s state. For example, EMS-only accounts will not see the NFIRS Export List option, and only Ohio customers will see the State EMS - Ohio option.
